# Kaggle Airline Analysis

## Description

Taking an airplane flight is one of the most ordinary ways of traveling around the world. There are hundreds of airline corporations from different nations that provide travel services for customers. 

We conducted an analysis based on a Kaggle dataset of airline passenger satisfaction. We used EDA visuals to understand the passengers' data and built machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, KNN) to answer our project's questions. We want to learn what can affect a passenger's satisfaction and how we can predict it. We focused on finding which rating scores have the strongest correlation with satisfaction, how the passenger class aids the prediction, and how do the delay and age affect the prediction. We also evaluated our model performances with different techniques of performance scores.

The data is from https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction.

The data includes a training dataset and a test dataset that have approximately 130,000 records of passenger satisfaction surveys. Each record's features includes the flight details (distance, departure time, arrival time...), a customer's private information (age, gender, customer type, flight class, travel type...), rating scores (seat comfort, entertainment, online checkin, gate convenience...), and whether a customer is satisfied or not.
