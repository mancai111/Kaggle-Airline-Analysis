# GWU DATS6103 Team 8 Data Mining Project

Taking an airplane flight is one of the most ordinary ways of traveling around the world. There are hundreds of airline corporations from different nations that provide travel services for customers. 

 

Team 8 will conduct an analysis based on a survey of airline passenger satisfaction. 
The data is from https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction.

 

The data source became available in 2018-2019. It includes a training dataset and a test dataset that have approximately 130,000 records of passenger satisfaction surveys across a wide range of ages in total. There are multiple factors that can indicate the quality of an airline service during the flight. 

 

## SMART questions:

- Which rating scores has the strongest correlation with satisfaction?

- Does a passenger tend to be satisfied with his or her trip based on the passenger class? 

- Is there a relationship between total delay time and departure/arrival convenience satisfaction?

- Is there a difference in satisfaction for older passengers (50+) when comparing short and long distance flights?

---------------------------

To investigate these questions, we may select to use logistic regression and other classification methods like classification trees or random forests. The link to the teamâ€™s GitHub repo is https://github.com/Charles-Graham/GWU_DATS6103_TEAM8
